<h4> Helper Assisted Delivery, Subject to Availability
</h4> <br />
<p>This is a step-up in service from our tailgate delivery option. For an additional charge, the helper will assist you in carrying the merchandise to the ground floor of your building. We recommend this choice if you do NOT have the staff available to take the merchandise off of the truck and inside your building. Batteries, Inverters, Furnitures and Heavy load items: additional options and charges may apply. A customer service representative will contact you with options.</p> <br />
